# ReactBlazorAdapter Demos

## create-react-app-JS

This is a very simple, unejected create-react-app using JavaScript. It has three total components:

* App
* SampleClass
* SampleHooks

The packaged JavaScript bundle is used in demos with "CRA" in the name. It uses these dependencies:

* create-react-app v5.x
* React 18.x

## Blazor-Standalone-CRA

This is a Blazor WebAssembly Standalone App project. It uses .NET 8.

## MAUI-Blazor-CRA-JS

This is a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid App project. It uses .NET 8.

## Future

I hope to add other examples, possibly with vite or typescript, for example. I'd also like to add support for older versions of React, and for .NET 6.
